# Narrowband-FM-Transmitter
A narrowband FM is the FM wave with a small bandwidth.

The FM systems are basically classified into following two types :
a)Narrowband FM
b)Wideband FM / Broadband FM

A narrowband FM is the FM wave with a small bandwidth, The modulation index mf of narrow band FM is small as compared to one radian. Hence, the spectrum of narrow band FM consists of the carrier and upper sideband and a lower sideband.

For small values of mf , the values of the j coefficients are as under :
J0(mf) = 1,
J1(mf) = mf/2
Jn(mf) = 0 for n > 1

Practically, the narrow band FM systems have mf less than 1 . The maximum permissible frequency deviation is restricted to about 5 kHz. This system is used in FM mobile communications such as police wireless, ambulances, taxicabs etc. This frequency modulation has a small bandwidth when compared to wideband FM. The modulation index Î² is small, i.e., less than 1.Its spectrum consists of the carrier, the upper sideband and the lower sideband. This is used in mobile communications such as police wireless, ambulances, taxicabs, etc.
